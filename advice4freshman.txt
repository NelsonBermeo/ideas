1. Explore topics like webdevelopment, cybersecurity, machine learning, etc and just type in subject simple project on youtube and just do them out and see how you feel about it. I could have done a simple project every weekend with 1-4 hours and learned so much, but no I probably watched anime or something 

2. your first semester you'll be taking i think like 15 credits, if youre scared of the workload you can be like okay this is enough classes,but if you are feeling spicy you can ask a the registrar staff hello can i take another class or 2 or i think you can go on workday and just register yourself idk max credits is 20

3. Also in addition to point 3 you could maybe rizz your way into a class that you don't have the prereqs for or that isn't a part of your thing just shoot me a question
