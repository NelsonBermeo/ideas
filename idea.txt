1. When I go to become a ta, let's teach the people how to make a the music app but with a simple gui

2. I wonder if we can reach out to the highschool to talk to children interested in computer science 

3. I think we should learn how the computer works in a way to program our own parent blocker

4. Webscrap course catalog, linked in and finance with chat gpt helper bot 

5. We can webscrape/automate our finances and we can either webscrap every week or maybe bankofamerica offers an export of finances every week which we can use 

6. Put this up on github and ask people if they would like to talk about it 

7. Make a program that can get though captchas, that's impossible?? 

8. Projects from youtube often have github repos and make great bases for greater and cooler projects. I wonder if I can look into the projects that other people have created off a youtube video and look into that youtubers community discord or something. 

9. Web scrapping is a form of data mining! So that's what Akcam does! 
10. Can I make a random program that connects to chat gpt? Like if i go on my IDE would it be possible to ask a question to chat gpt from there? Like hey ask chat gpt how its doing and give me back the answer? 

11. We can write the functions ourselves with our own knowledge then ask chat gpt how we can add matplotlib, seaborn, pandas or numpy 

12. I'd like to learn how to hack one day, frick i wish i explored more during my freshman year

13. Add content creators to my site

14. django is still a bit confusing to me with how we utilize models and our own logic, maybe we can use chatgpt to help guide us through a simple project like getting user input numbers and graphing them or like adding them or seomthing that involved classic python

15. So i guess well spend the rest of summer doing the following: we have about 6 weeks so lets timeline this all out: 
This is all being completed within a month to grasp the topics not master them, that is what the remainder of my college learning will be for

Week 1: ML Specialization
Week 2: ML/DL Specialization
Week 3: DL Specialization
Week 4: QM/QC
Week 5: QML YT
    Good Resources Could Be:

Week 6: Django + Finish Portfolio

16. Luis von Ahn - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6FORpg0KVo - So i just watched this video because I wonder if anyone else has ever been in the situation of internet addiction and I wonder how they fought and got through it. The title of this video was "How to Make Learning as Addictive as Social Media" and the video wasn't an exact solution to my problem, but it did give me a great idea. Luis says that a learning app on your phone looks like brocolli next to desert (tiktok, instagram, etc). But he made the brocolli taste like desert by making it feel like a game and setting reminders. Something I have been doing is memorizing algorithms like bubblesort, the syntax for linked lists implementation and many more. I set sometime everyday to implement any algorithm from a blank file from memorization, but It's a little lame its hard sometimes to get yourself to do it. Its not nessesary, but I think it'd be great and very helpful to make a django application that gives you a random prompt: "Implement selection sort" from a list of algorithms and there'd be a stats page for a streak number, maybe customization of a charcter idk, something gamy and trackable. I think this phycologically would help people want to practise algorithms. This is a great idea I hope I can finish this project by the end of the year. --> But is it more beneficial to work on something that you hate? To build that willpower? I don't know. Goggins and Huberman seem to lean towards the latter.

17. Dr. K (HealthyGamerGG) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKNRXuZWYYg&t=5s - Live your life as if you are a different person spawning in everyday into your body and your goal is to try and make the situation better for the guy who'll play the game tomorrow. Why? Well because... --> I feel like im looking for some advice or hack but the simple answer is that there is none (david's idea) but idk let me keep thinking. 

18. I am a massive procrasitator, and addicted to dopamine. But I am trying to get better. I'll share my story soon and hope I can help other students at stevens or just random people. --> I'm on youtube rn looking for someone with a simlar story and understanding their struggle. 

19. How do you meditate?

20. I want to rent out my book for free during the year at stevens and itd be cool to make an application or program to track whos got my book and for how long

21. The way to quit bad habits isn't to restrict yourself from them, but to free yourself from them. Being aware of them always and changing your thoughts about them.
